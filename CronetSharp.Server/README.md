# Websockets Server
This project is a websockets server for CronetSharp, 
so you can send requests and read responses from another language or a webapp, using the [websockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) protocol.

## Usage
After the binaries have been built, run: `CronetSharp.Server.exe <port>`.

`port` is optional; it will default to `8855`.
